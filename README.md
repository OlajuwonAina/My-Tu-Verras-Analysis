## Task
The problem the code tries to solve is to analyze a dataset (specifically the Boston dataset) by loading it, summarizing it, visualizing it with histograms and scatter plots, computing correlation matrix, and fitting a linear regression model to make predictions. The challenge lies in understanding and manipulating the dataset and applying the appropriate data analysis techniques.

## Description
The code solves the problem by performing the following tasks: loading the dataset, summarizing it, cleaning it by removing rows with missing values, plotting histograms to visualize the distribution of each column, plotting a scatter matrix to visualize relationships between columns, computing the correlation matrix, and fitting a linear regression model and making predictions.

## Installation
There is no need to install the project since it does not involve any external libraries or packages. One can simply run the code on any IDE or Python environment.

## Usage
The code works by first loading the Boston dataset using pandas, then it summarizes the dataset's shape and statistical summary, and plots histograms and scatter matrix using matplotlib. It then computes the correlation matrix using pandas, and finally, it fits a linear regression model using the "RM" column as the input feature and "MDEV" column as the target variable. It then makes predictions for the given data using the fitted model.

### The Core Team
This project was a two team member project. I, Olajuwon Aina and Winifred Chinenye Soligbo Fidelis.
